Cat Man is roaming the skies of Gotem City. Suddenly, he sees blocks of unknown energy floating in the air. 

One solution was found to be to blow them out of the sky using the lazer torpedoes installed in the Cat Mobile.

Another was to simply ignore the threat and let it go past you, in which case it would be believed that you may have a hand in the injuries of multiple innocent residents across Gotem City.

You want to help Gotem City survive, so get started on getting high scores!!
