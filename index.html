  Cat Man is roaming the skies of Gotem City. Suddenly, he sees blocks of unknown energy floating in the air.
  <br/><br/>
  One solution was found to be to blow them out of the sky using the lazer torpedoes installed in the Cat Mobile.
  <br/><br/>
  Another was to simply ignore the threat and let it go past you, in which case it would be believed that you may have a hand in the injuries of multiple innocent residents across Gotem City.
  <br/><br/>
  You want to help Gotem City survive, so get started on getting high scores!!
  <br/><br/>
  Use W/S or ↑/↓ to control the Cat Mobile and Click to shoot! Remember, each bullet lost doesn't come back in that life!
